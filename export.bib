   abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide a survey of the various stages in the development of response surface methodology (RSM). The coverage of these stages is organized in three parts that describe the evolution of RSM since its introduction in the early 1950s. Part I covers the period, 1951-1975, during which the so-called classicalRSMwas developed. This includes a review of basic experimental designs for fitting linear response surface models, in addition to a description of methods for the determination of optimum operating conditions. Part II, which covers the period, 1976-1999, discusses more recent modeling techniques in RSM, in addition to a coverage of Taguchi's robust parameter design and its response surface alternative approach. Part III provides a coverage of further extensions and research directions in modern RSM. This includes discussions concerning response surface models with random effects, generalized linear models, and graphical techniques for comparing response surface designs. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

The results obtained in such manner represent the design space more precisely than in the case of One-Variable-At-Time (OVAT) approach, leading to reliable and comprehensive results, while saving time and resources. Despite such a large increase of interest in this approach recently, its implementation in metabolomics research seems to be limited. Therefore, in this short overview, apart from summarizing some basic concepts of DoE, we wanted to provide a guideline for those who are about to plan metabolomics-related experiments. This overview is divided into four sections. In addition to the first section, which will introduce the history and basics of DoE, second part will provide concise description of the most popular experimental designs. Furthermore, third section will describe examples of DoE application in metabolomics and related studies. We will conclude with fourth section, providing you briefly with opportunities and trends in metabolomics research utilizing experimental design.},

The continuous and large scale production of biodiesel from edible oils has recently been of great concern because they compete with food materials-the food versus fuel dispute. This paper reviewed the prospect of making biodiesel from some non-edible seed oils of Castor, Jatropha curcas, Neem and Yelllow oleander. The physico chemical properties reviewed were compared with ASTM D6751-07a standards for biodiesel and found to have satisfied the international standards. The review gave physicochemical properties, torque outputs, brake power, brake thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumptions that are close to those of fossil fuel diesel thus confirming that they can be used as alternative fuels in diesel engines.},

The physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were studied by various techniques such as differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA-TGA), BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (TPD-CO2), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that the heterogeneous catalyst calcined at 900°C exhibited good catalytic activity in the transesterification of WCO, providing maximum biodiesel yield of 89.33% at 5.0g of catalyst loading, 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio at temperature of 65°C in reaction time of 4h. The better catalytic activity of the aforementioned catalyst in the biodiesel reaction could be attributed to the presence of optimal number of catalytically active basic site density on its surface. Moreover, the catalyst was successfully recycled for 4 times for biodiesel production.},

   abstract = {The use of organic waste materials conjugated with inorganic sources as a bifunctional catalyst for one-step biodiesel production is currently under-utilized. In this study, a bifunctional catalyst for biodiesel production was developed from poultry droppings doped with ferric sulphate (FSPD). Its catalytic activity was investigated in simultaneous esterification and transesterification of neem seed oil (NSO) using methanol. Response Surface Methodology was employed in modelling and optimizing the reaction conditions. The characterization of the catalyst was done using Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffractometer. Fe (46.08 wt. %), S (22.31 wt. %), and Ca (11.82 wt. %) were the major elements present in the FSPD and the other results revealed that it is bifunctionally active. A biodiesel yield of 97.21% and acid value (AV) of 0.5 mg KOH/g were obtained at the optimum conditions of 21:1 methanol/oil ratio, 5 wt. %, catalyst loading and reaction temperature of 65°C after 180 min. The biodiesel produced using FSPD catalyst meets both the ASTM D6751 and the EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Reusability investigation of the FSPD showed remarkable stability up to the third reuse cycle with a slight decrease in biodiesel yield and a corresponding increase in acid value from 97.21% to 90.05% and 0.5–0.81 mg KOH/g respectively. The utilization of FSPD as a bifunctional catalyst is significant for improving the biodiesel output of high FFA oil and overall biodiesel production time.},

The lack of specificity of this technique, on the one hand, permits us to probe directly the vibrational properties of almost all the cofactors, amino acid side chains, and of water molecules. On the other hand, we can use reaction-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy to select vibrations corresponding to single chemical groups involved in a specific reaction. Various strategies are used to identify the IR signatures of each residue of interest in the resulting reaction-induced FTIR difference spectra. (Specific) Isotope labeling, site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen/deuterium exchange are often used to identify the chemical groups. Studies on model compounds and the increasing use of theoretical chemistry for normal modes calculations allow us to interpret the IR frequencies in terms of specific structural characteristics of the chemical group or molecule of interest.

Three-factor ANOVA analysis showed that neither the exposure temperature, nor whether the burning occurred with or without soft tissue present had any significant influence on the bone's overall elemental makeup (p > 0.05). The Ca/P ratio remained in the osseous typical range of between 1.6 and 2.58 in all analyzed samples. This demonstrates that even faced with high temperatures, the overall gross elemental content and atomic percentage of elements in bone remain stable, creating a unique “fingerprint” for osseous material, even after exposure to extreme conditions.},

Schematic drawings with SEM components pictures were provided for understanding the procedure of work in easy and true way. Also, types of SEM were presented and discussed. The capability of energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was also presented; this included historical background of EDS and how it works in accordance with SEM. The existence of EDS capability with SEM instrument is very essential for qualitative and quantitative analysis for any specimen. In the absence of EDS only information on surface topography of the specimen can be produced through SEM. The two most powerful features of SEM image are introduced and discussed namely secondary electron imaging and backscattered electron imaging. Understanding principle of work of both features is very important to have a complete knowledge on how SEM instrument works. SEM is characterized by its easy operation. Having that knowledge one can manage to perform the analysis and imaging very smoothly.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel is the mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from renewable lipid feedstock, such as vegetable oils and animal fats, for use in compression ignition (diesel) engines. The conversion of component triglycerides in oils to simple alkyl esters with short chain alcohols like methanol and ethanol amongst others is achieved mainly by transesterification. The transesterification reaction, a reversible process proceeds appreciably by the addition of catalysts, which can be acidic, basic or organic in nature, usually in molar excess of alcohol. The economy of the process depends on the type and quantity of catalyst used among other factors. The catalyst can be homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on whether it is in the same or different phase with the reactants; oils and alcohols. This paper attempts to give an insight into some of the various types of catalysts that have been used to effect the transesterification of vegetable, waste and animal oils in biodiesel production.},

Biodiesel as an alternative energy source has become a research focus. The most common method for biodiesel production is transesterification, in which lipid and low carbon alcohol are commonly used as raw materials, in the presence of a catalyst. In the process of transesterification, the performance of the catalyst is the key factor of the biodiesel yield. This paper reviews the recent research progress on homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production. The advantages and disadvantages of current homogeneous acid catalysts and homogeneous base catalysts are discussed, and heteropolyacid heterogeneous catalysts and biomass-derived base catalysts are described. The applications of the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst derivatives ionic liquids/deep eutectic solvents and nanocatalysts/magnetic catalysts in biodiesel production are reviewed. The mechanism and economic cost of current homogeneous acid catalysts and homogeneous base catalysts are also analyzed. The unique advantages of each type of catalyst are compared to better understand the microscopic details behind biodiesel. Finally, some challenges of current biodiesel catalysts are summarized, and future research directions are presented. This review will provide general and in-depth knowledge on the achievements, directions, and research priorities in developing novel homogeneous/heterogeneous catalysts for the green and cost-effective production of biodiesel.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel is one of the potential alternative energy sources that can be derived from renewable and low-grade origin through different processes. One of the processes is alcoholysis or transesterification in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The catalyst can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. This article reviews various catalysts used for biodiesel production to date, presents the state of the art of types of catalysts, and compares their suitability and associated challenges in the transesterification process. Biodiesel production using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has been studied extensively, and novel heterogeneous catalysts are being continuously investigated. Homogeneous catalysts are generally efficient in converting biodiesel with low free fatty acid (FFA) and water containing single-origin feedstock. Heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide superior activity, range of selectivity, good FFA, and water adaptability. The quantity and strengths of active acid or basic sites control these properties. Some of the heterogeneous catalysts such as zirconia and zeolite-based catalysts can be used as both basic and acidic catalyst by suitable alteration. Heterogeneous catalysts from waste and biocatalysts play an essential role in attaining a sustainable alternative to traditional homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. Recently, high catalytic efficiency at mild operating conditions has drawn attention to nanocatalysts. This review evaluates state of the art and perspectives for catalytic biodiesel production and assesses the critical operational variables that influence biodiesel production along with the technological solutions for sustainable implementation of the process.},

   abstract = {Transesterification is one of the methods for biodiesel production in which oil or fat is reacted with alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst to form alkyl ester and glycerol. The cost of biodiesel production is mainly affected by the system used and cost of feedstock. Currently, waste oil or fat is used in the production of biodiesel as 70 to 90% of the production cost is attributed to raw materials. Alternatively, overall cost of production can also be reduced by optimizing the efficiency of catalyst used. Therefore, this review paper is aimed to give an overview on the recent trends of catalyzed transesterification and the advantages and disadvantages of heterogeneous acid/base, homogeneous acid/base, and enzymatic transesterification. Heterogeneous base catalyst is commonly used because of its reusability, easier to separate from product, higher reaction rate, lower cost, and require less energy as compared to acid-catalyzed transesterification. However, heterogeneous base catalyst still suffers with the limitations of diffusion, possibility of saponification to occur, sensitive to FFA content and produce more wastewater. With intense research focus and development, an ideal catalyst can indeed be develop for optimum production of biodiesel that economically feasible and environmentally benign for a better future.},

In this context, biodiesel is considered one of the most important fuels, and hence has received the most attention. Biodiesel is a nontoxic renewable fuel that can be used to replace petro-diesel with little or no change in the engine. It can be produced from different feedstocks, including vegetable oil, animal fat, waste cooking oil (WCO), and microalga oil. The selection of an appropriate oil source (feedstock) is very important, because it determines whether or not biodiesel production is cost-effective. The catalyst plays a vital role in the transesterification process. Several types of catalyst are commonly used, including homogeneous alkaline catalyst, homogeneous acid catalyst, enzymatic catalyst, and heterogeneous alkaline catalyst. Among these, heterogeneous alkaline catalysts have shown a high yield in biodiesel production. Recently, they have attracted a great deal of attention due to their high specific surface area, high catalytic activity, and high efficiency. In addition, several nanocatalysts have recently been developed for effective production of biodiesel. However, a number of variables, including temperature, contact time, catalyst content, and alcohol to oil molar ratio, have been found to affect catalyst efficiency. This chapter discusses various feedstocks, methods, and other factors affecting biodiesel production.},

It is derived from renewable resources, it has less emission to environment, it is biodegradable so has very limited toxicity and above all its production can be decentralized so that it could have a potential in helping rural economies. However, there are also some worth mentioning challenges associated with production of biodiesel. Among them repeatedly mentioned are the cost of feedstock and the choice of convenient technology for efficient production of the fuel from diverse feedstock types. There are four main routes by which raw vegetable oil and/or animal fat can be made suitable for use as substituent fuel in diesel engines without modification. These are direct use or blending of oils, micro-emulsion, thermal cracking or pyrolysis and transesterification reaction. Due to the quality of the fuel produced, the transesterification method is the most preferred way to produce biodiesel from diverse feedstock types. Through this method, oils and fats (triglycerides) are converted to their alkyl esters with reduced viscosity to near diesel fuel levels. There are different techniques to carry out transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages as well as its own specifically convenient feedstock character. There are also some very important reaction conditions to be given due attention in each of this techniques for efficient production of biodiesel, such as molar ratio of alcohol to oil, type and amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, reaction time, reaction medium, type and relative amount of solvents, among others. This review is meant to investigate the main transesterification techniques for biodiesel production in terms of their choice of feedstock character as well as their determinately required reaction conditions for efficient biodiesel production, so that to give an overview on their advantages and disadvantages.},

An alternative fuel must be technically feasible, economical, environmentally friendly. One of the alternative fuels is biodiesel. Biodiesel is an alternative, non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable fuel obtained from renewable energy sources. Vegetable oils from oilseed crops such as biodiesel, rapeseed (canola), sunflower, soybean, safflower, animal fats, short chain alcoholic waste in the presence of catalyst can be obtained from home frying oils. Biodiesel does not contain oil; but it can be used as a fuel by mixing it with pure or any oil based diesel. In other words, biodiesel are mono alkyl esters obtained by reaction of vegetable fatty acid esters under certain conditions with simple alcohols such as methanol or ethanol. The types of vegetable oil used as a source of raw materials in biodiesel production are very important. Because the types and ratios of the fatty acids in the oil used indicate the fuel quality of the produced biodiesel. Biodiesel is produced by dilution, microemulsion, pyrolysis and transesterification. In addition, there are studies to treat the wastewater produced during biodiesel production.

Transesterification with conventional catalysts has some disadvantages, and for this reason, alternative methods of biodiesel production have been investigated. These solutions include the replacement of chemical catalysts with biological ones, which show substrate specificity in relation to fats. Replacing chemical with biological catalysts causes elimination of some disadvantages of chemical processes, for instance: high temperatures of reaction, problematic process of glycerol purification, higher alcohol-to-oil molar ratios, and soap formation. Moreover, it causes operational cost reduction and has a positive environmental impact. This is due to the lower temperature of the process, which in turn translates into lower cost of equipment and lower GHG emissions associated with the need to provide less heat to the process. The increase of biofuels’ demand has led to the technology of enzymatic biodiesel production being constantly being developed. This research mainly focuses on the possibility of obtaining cheaper and more effective biocatalysts, as well as increasing the durability of enzyme immobilization on different materials.},

   abstract = {Due to the dwindling crude oil resources and the detrimental environmental effects of toxic emissions from conventional diesel, biodiesel has gained importance over the last few years as a clean, sustainable, and renewable energy resource. As projected by the Energy Outlook review, a blend of 30 % biodiesel with petro-diesel (B30), is expected to be promoted as an alternative to petro-diesel by the year 2030. From the global perception, biodiesel is estimated to form 70 % of transport fuel which will be in demand by the year 2040. Since biodiesel is produced exclusively by vegetable oil, animal fat, microbial oil, and waste oil, it is renewable and biodegradable. Even though it has various benefits over conventional diesel fuel, yet numerous technical challenges need to be resolved. Among them are the cost of oil, selection of appropriate catalysts, and the development of a suitable technique for economical and efficient synthesis of biodiesel fuel from the vast range of available feedstocks. As 60-80 % cost of biodiesel is due to its feedstock, selection of low cost and sustainable feedstock from the vast varieties of available sources is the most challenging task to be achieved. In this article, the literature of the last twenty years was thoroughly studied and reviewed to examine the status of biodiesel. The present paper discusses the availability of different biodiesel feedstocks and summarises how their characteristics affect biodiesel properties along with the criteria of their selection for sustainable and low-cost production of biodiesel. The transesterification route is considered the most appropriate way for processing triglycerides of lipids into biodiesel which can take place with or without a catalyst. Different catalysts can homogeneously or heterogeneously catalyze the transesterification reaction depending on their solubility in the reaction mixture. The paper reviews the research on biodiesel production with different types of catalysts (alkaline, acidic, and enzymatic), their properties, preferred operating conditions, their suitability, and limitations. Work done on some of the latest intensification techniques for biodiesel production that are capable of managing the mass transfer restrictions of oil and alcohol phases namely, microwave irradiation, ultrasonication, and the co-solvent method are also reviewed. Some other intensification techniques that reduce biodiesel production cost by efficient separation, mixing, purification, and reaction like membrane reactor, motionless mixer, reactive distillation, and in-situ method have also been discussed along with their scope for commercialization in the context of the research work done till date. The review concludes with future perspectives and suggestions regarding the selection criteria of feedstocks, catalysts, and production techniques to make the production of biodiesel cost-effective, fast, energy-efficient, more cleaner, less complex, and sustainable.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel, comprising mono alkyl fatty acid esters or methyl ethyl esters, is an encouraging option to fossil fuels or diesel produced from petroleum; it has comparable characteristics and its use has the potential to diminish carbon dioxide production and greenhouse gas emissions. Manufactured from recyclable and sustainable feedstocks, e.g., oils originating from vegetation, biodiesel has biodegradable properties and has no toxic impact on ecosystems. The evolution of biodiesel has been precipitated by the continuing environmental damage created by the deployment of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is predominantly synthesised via transesterification and esterification procedures. These involve a number of key constituents, i.e., the feedstock and catalytic agent, the proportion of methanol to oil, the circumstances of the reaction and the product segregation and purification processes. Elements that influence the yield and standard of the obtained biodiesel encompass the form and quantity of the feedstock and reaction catalyst, the proportion of alcohol to feedstock, the temperature of the reaction, and its duration. Contemporary research has evaluated the output of biodiesel reactors in terms of energy production and timely biodiesel manufacture. In order to synthesise biodiesel for industrial use efficaciously, it is essential to acknowledge the technological advances that have significant potential in this sector. The current paper therefore offers a review of contemporary progress, feedstock categorisation, and catalytic agents for the manufacture of biodiesel and production reactors, together with modernised processing techniques. The production reactor, form of catalyst, methods of synthesis, and feedstock standards are additionally subjects of discourse so as to detail a comprehensive setting pertaining to the chemical process. Numerous studies are ongoing in order to develop increasingly efficacious techniques for biodiesel manufacture; these acknowledge the use of solid catalytic agents and non-catalytic supercritical events. This review appraises the contemporary situation with respect to biodiesel production in a range of contexts. The spectrum of techniques for the efficacious manufacture of biodiesel encompasses production catalysed by homogeneous or heterogeneous enzymes or promoted by microwave or ultrasonic technologies. A description of the difficulties to be surmounted going forward in the sector is presented.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel is a long-chain fatty acid ester made from renewed and biological raw materials such as used cooking, animal fat, vegetable oil, and algae. Biodiesel is a renewable and clean fuel as it reduces carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter emissions compared with petroleum-based diesel fuel. Production of biodiesel from renewable resources is done through the transesterification reaction at which the organic group (alkyl) of alcohol is substituted with the organic group of a triglyceride- the main component of the feedstock -producing fatty acid alkyl ester (biodiesel) and crude glycerol. Biodiesel can be used in pure form (B100) or may be blended with petroleum diesel at any concentration if its specifications is identical to the international standard specifications provided by American standard for testing materials (ASTM) or EN14214 in the European Union for alternative fuels. In this paper, the different types of biodiesel feedstocks, feedstocks treatment methods, and biodiesel production technologies are reviewed and discussed.},

   abstract = {Continuous increase in world's population, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth force for continuously increase in fossil fuel consumption to meet growing energy demand. Continuous emissions from burning of fossil fuel will create the need to find the appropriate and sustainable replacement for fossil fuels. Biodiesel is appropriate alternate solution for diesel engine due to its renewable, non-toxic and eco-friendly nature. According to EASAC biodiesel evolution is classified into four generations. Cultivation in arid and semi arid land or water, crop yield, effect on food supply, yield of biodiesel, energy content, carbon-neutral economy, easy availability, and economic viable are the main factors behind the evolution of biodiesel generations. This article highlights a comprehensive assessment of various feedstocks used for different generation biodiesel production with their advantages and disadvantages. Different production methods for biodiesel with yield calculation are also explained. Algae based third generation feedstocks are better in comparison with first and second generation due to their high energy content, high oil content and less polluting nature. Forth generation of biodiesel produced from synthetic biology, which will enhance the various physiochemical properties of biodiesel to achieve carbon neutral economy. Among the all biodiesel production processes; transesterification is the most suitable process, because it produces biodiesel of high yield, comparable properties with diesel. This process is also feasible as per economic point of view. The energy demand of future can be met by the blending of different generation oil feedstocks.},

Biodiesel has been gaining worldwide popularity as an alternative energy source because it is non toxic, biodegradable & non flammable. Various edible and non edible oils, like rice bran oil, coconut oil, Jatropha curcas, castor oil, cottonseed oil, mahua, karanja which are either surplus and are nonedible type can be used for preparation of biodiesel. Biodiesel can be used either in the pure form or as blends on conventional petrodiesel in automobiles without any major modifications. Its biodegradability makes it eco-friendly. It may lead to a revolutionary transformation of the current economic & energy scenario with an era of economic bloom & prosperity for our society.

   abstract = {Biodiesel, defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats, is an environmentally attractive alternative to conventional petroleum diesel fuel (petrodiesel). Produced by transesterification with a monohydric alcohol, usually methanol, biodiesel has many important technical advantages over petrodiesel, such as inherent lubricity, low toxicity, derivation from a renewable and domestic feedstock, superior flash point and biodegradability, negligible sulfur content, and lower exhaust emissions. Important disadvantages of biodiesel include high feedstock cost, inferior storage and oxidative stability, lower volumetric energy content, inferior low-temperature operability, and in some cases, higher NO x exhaust emissions. This review covers the process by which biodiesel is prepared, the types of catalysts that may be used for the production of biodiesel, the influence of free fatty acids on biodiesel production, the use of different monohydric alcohols in the preparation of biodiesel, the influence of biodiesel composition on fuel properties, the influence of blending biodiesel with other fuels on fuel properties, alternative uses for biodiesel, and value-added uses of glycerol, a co-product of biodiesel production. A particular emphasis is placed on alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production. Lastly, future challenges and outlook for biodiesel are discussed.},

Since the source of biodiesel varies with the location and other sources such as recycled oils are continuously gaining interest, it is important to possess data on how the various fatty acid profiles of the different sources can influence biodiesel fuel properties. The properties of the various individual fatty esters that comprise biodiesel determine the overall fuel properties of the biodiesel fuel. In turn, the properties of the various fatty esters are determined by the structural features of the fatty acid and the alcohol moieties that comprise a fatty ester. Structural features that influence the physical and fuel properties of a fatty ester molecule are chain length, degree of unsaturation, and branching of the chain. Important fuel properties of biodiesel that are influenced by the fatty acid profile and, in turn, by the structural features of the various fatty esters are cetane number and, ultimately, exhaust emissions, cold flow, oxidative stability, viscosity, and lubricity.},

   abstract = {The recent energy independence and climate change policies encourage development and utilization of renewable energy such as bioenergy. Biofuels in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms have been intensively researched, produced, and used over the past 15 years. This paper reviews the worldwide history, current status, and predictable future trend of bioenergy and biofuels. Bioenergy has been utilized for cooking, heating, and lighting since the dawn of humans. The energy stored in annually produced biomass by terrestrial plants is 3-4 times greater than the current global energy demand. Solid biofuels include firewood, wood chips, wood pellets, and wood charcoal. The global consumption of firewood and charcoal has been remaining relatively constant, but the use of wood chips and wood pellets for electricity (biopower) generation and residential heating doubled in the past decade and will increase steadily into the future. Liquid biofuels cover bioethanol, biodiesel, pyrolysis bio-oil, and drop-in transportation fuels. Commercial production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials has just started, supplementing the annual supply of 22 billion gallons predominantly from food crops. Biodiesel from oil seeds reached the 5670 million gallons/yr production capacity, with further increases depending on new feedstock development. Bio-oil and drop-in biofuels are still in the development stage, facing cost-effective conversion and upgrading challenges. Gaseous biofuels extend to biogas and syngas. Production of biogas from organic wastes by anaerobic digestion has been rapidly increasing in Europe and China, with the potential to displace 25% of the current natural gas consumption. In comparison, production of syngas from gasification of woody biomass is not cost-competitive and therefore, narrowly practiced. Overall, the global development and utilization of bioenergy and biofuels will continue to increase, particularly in the biopower, lignocellulosic bioethanol, and biogas sectors. It is expected that by 2050 bioenergy will provide 30% of the world's demanded energy.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel, a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional diesel fuel, has garnered significant attention due to its potential to address pressing energy and environmental challenges. Biodiesel is a biofuel derived from organic materials, typically vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking oils, through a process known as transesterification. During this process, these feedstocks are chemically converted into biodiesel and glycerol using alcohol and a catalyst. The resulting biodiesel can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel, either in pure form (B100) or blended with petroleum diesel (e.g., B5, B20). Biodiesel is also known for its compatibility with existing diesel engines and infrastructure, which facilitates its adoption without significant modifications. However, challenges such as feedstock competition with food crops, energy balance concerns, and land-use change associated with biodiesel feedstock cultivation must be considered. Additionally, ongoing research focuses on improving the production process, exploring alternative feedstocks, and optimizing engine performance. Biodiesel represents a promising solution to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation sector and enhance energy security. Its advantages in emissions reduction, compatibility, and renewability make it a crucial player in the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Addressing challenges while continuing to advance the state of the art in biodiesel production and application is essential for its successful integration into our energy landscape.

To achieve this goal, different technologies have been proposed and developed to recover energy from waste, including incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and transesterification. Faced with a variety of waste materials and different available technologies, how to choose an appropriate technology and/or a combination of different technologies is a challenge for the decision-makers. Sustainability evaluation of the technology and/or the combination of technologies could offer a solid comparative base for the decision-makers. Therefore in this chapter, a brief description of the waste classification and the current waste-to-energy technologies are introduced. Then the sustainability assessment methodology is discussed, mainly focusing on the life cycle sustainability assessment methodology. A detailed discussion of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing, and social LCA is presented, as well as a comprehensive review of the recently published papers. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are given in the last section.},

The abovementioned points coincide with the sustainable development goals 7 (SDG 7) and 11 (SDG 11) of the United Nations (UN), respectively. Adopting waste-to-energy system could leverage on the possibility of reducing the adverse environmental impact occasioned by waste generation and ensuring production of renewable and sustainable energy while achieving circular economy. A review of most commonly used technologies for solid waste management worldwide, such as incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling with gas recovery in order to achieve waste-to-energy nexus is presented. A brief discussion on the economic, environmental and social impact as well as the implementation levels, some challenges and possible solutions to the implementation of the mentioned technologies for both developed and developing countries are included. This paper also addresses waste-to-energy (WtE) as a contributor to achieving sustainable development. It is evident from this paper that the waste stream of developing countries contained 50–56% food and garden wastes making anaerobic digestion technology more appropriate for treatment.

   abstract = {This mini-review aims at proving that waste-to-energy (WtE) is an essential cornerstone for circular economy (CE). Based on literature, the history of thermal waste treatment over the last 150 years is investigated, from open burning to WtE with resource recovery and final sink function. The results show that in the past incineration solved the issues it was designed for but often created new and sometimes even worse problems: The introduction of incineration in the 19th century improved urban sanitation, decreased waste volume and prolonged operational life of landfills. But it also polluted the environment, triggering an unprecedented scientific and engineering effort of all stakeholders. Today, WtE is one of the best investigated and optimized technologies in waste management. It enables the recovery of energy as heat and electric power and facilitates the ‘cleaning’ of cycles by the destruction of hazardous organic substances. Recent developments in resource recovery from WtE residues allow to recycle metals and, in the case of sewage sludge, even phosphorus by thermal recycling. Combined with carbon capture and storage technology, WtE stands for a quantifiable contribution to greenhouse gas reduction. Today, WtE is indispensable to reach the goals of CE, namely recycling of energy and materials, supplying safe final sinks for persistent organic substances and minimizing the need for sinks for hazardous inorganic substances.},

   abstract = {With the immediate actions required to address environmental issues posed by waste generation and the growing interest in the circular economy, anaerobic digestion (AD) offers a promising solution. As a major component of waste-to-energy, AD plays a dual role by processing waste and generating renewable energy at the same time, thus contributing to the success of closed-loop systems. However, the success of AD as a business remains uncertain due to the high costs of material handling. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), this study reveals AD-specific key barriers in feedstock exchanges and typical strategies applied to address them. The dual role of AD and the involvement of different stakeholders in the upstream processes further complicate these challenges, thus necessitating a more holistic approach to strategy formulation—an aspect not fully covered in the current literature. These gaps present opportunities to theorise the unique operations of AD businesses and the dynamics of multi-stakeholders in complex feedstock supply processes. This study integrates resource management theories and duality theory, proposing a theoretical framework to enhance the sustainability and circularity of AD ventures. The proposed framework views AD from a resource-oriented perspective and thus reinforces its pivotal role in fostering a truly closed-loop system within the circular economy.},

   abstract = {There is an intimate connection between energy, the environment and sustainable development. A society seeking sustainable development ideally must utilize only energy resources which cause no environmental impact (e.g. which release no emissions to the environment). However, since all energy resources lead to some environmental impact, it is reasonable to suggest that some (not all) of the concerns regarding the limitations imposed on sustainable development by environmental emissions and their negative impacts can be in part overcome through increased energy efficiency. Clearly, a strong relation exists between energy efficiency and environmental impact since, for the same services or products, less resource utilization and pollution is normally associated with increased energy efficiency. Presented in this paper are (i) a comprehensive discussion of the future of energy use and the consequent environmental impacts in terms of acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect, (ii) some solutions to current environmental issues in terms of energy conservation and renewable energy technologies, (iii) some theoretical and practical limitations on increased energy efficiency, (iv) discussions of the relations between energy and sustainable development, and between the environment and sustainable development, and an (v) illustrative example. In this regard, a number of issues relating to energy, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. In addition, some recommendations are drawn from the results we present for the use of energy scientists and engineers and policy makers, along with the anticipated effects.},

   abstract = {For several decades, in many countries around the world biofuels have been an integral part of the energy market portfolio. While introduced as a new technology and a complementary energy source, in some cases supported by governmental subsidies, in recent years biofuels production has become controversial. On the one hand, due to subsidy policies biofuels became a competitive energy source, thus determining blending rules for traditional gasoline, and directly impacting fossil fuel markets. On the other hand, economic, environmental, and social benefits of biofuels, although widely acknowledged in the literature in general, have been questioned in terms of their scope and extent. In the face of ongoing scientific and professional discussions on biofuels, it is important to delineate differences and similarities among various biofuels feedstocks, processes, and technologies. It is specifically the diversity of those technologies that will determine and allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the final economic, environmental, and social sustainability levels of biofuels produced from the respective feedstocks and with different processes. This chapter will provide a closer look at these issues at hand.},

   abstract = {Recently, energy has been a research area due to increasing awareness of its advantages. Energy is essential for all daily activities and helps the mind and body grows; it has the ability to determine the growth of an economy and the development of a country. However, energy has its disadvantages. Nonrenewable energy is energy such as fossil fuel, which is the main cause of air pollutant emissions, such as carbon dioxide, synthetic fluorinated gases, water vapor, and methane gases; and nuclear energy, its wastes are the main cause of air pollutant. They are also the main cause of global warming, human health, climate change, and environmental degradation from the extraction up to use. Nowadays, fossil fuel energy is used in production and use of energy in all sectors of the world. Nuclear energy is the most powerful energy source. Renewable energy, such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, tidal, wave, and hydrogen energy, produces zero greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, reducing air pollution and combating climate change, improving public health, mitigating smog and acid rain, and long-term sustainability. The production and use of this renewable energy has been increasing, but it is not sufficient to meet the demand of all sectors in the world. Hydrogen energy is the future of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, free of CO2 emissions, and radioactive waste. The hydrogen economy envisions using hydrogen as a clean, versatile, and sustainable energy carrier to replace fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We must control the impacts of energy first by knowing the types of energy and their impact, and then totally replace nonrenewable energy with renewable energy in the future by increasing the efficiency of renewable energy. To increase the efficiency of energy production, energy storage (storing high amount of energy in a small space) uses nanomaterials and green nanomaterial technologies. International cooperation and policy alignment will be essential for driving global transition to a sustainable energy future. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the energy sector becomes more sustainable, efficient, and resilient, supporting the transition toward a low-carbon future. Harmonizing energy policies, sharing best practices, and aligning climate commitments can facilitate the development of a coordinated approach to addressing energy challenges on a global scale. By incorporating these considerations into energy planning and decision-making, stakeholders can work toward building a future energy system that is sustainable, resilient, and capable of meeting the energy needs of a rapidly changing world. In this study, a critical review of the type, form, storage, advantages, efficiency, respective, and their impact are reviewed. The amounts of energy produced by each type in different years are discussed.},

Our work presents the preparation of nanomagnesium oxide (MgO) by the sol–gel method, and its characterization. Optimum conditions and the productive combination of waste cooking oil, methanol, and the synthesized nanocatalyst were predicted using response surface methodology.

In the face of the current staggering level of youth unemployment in Nigeria, there is the obvious need to seek for ways of empowering the youth for sustainable development. Poultry keeping stands as resource that can generate employment for millions of Nigerian youths in rural and peri-urban areas as entrepreneurs, skilled and unskilled workers. This paper through a review of literature examined the importance of poultry and explored how it can be exploited as a panacea for youth unemployment through entrepreneurship. It explores the potentials of it and shows the way the potentials of poultry can be harnessed for all youth empowerment programmes. It recommended that government, big farms, international and national corporations, should be involved in youth empowerment programmes through youth entrepreneurship in poultry production. Banks and other financial institutions should be mandated to assist the youth with soft loans in cash and kind through the provision of poultry infrastructure so as to make poultry farming attractive to the youth. A well-funded poultry extension advisory service need to be established to ensure the sustainability of the youth empowerment/ entrepreneurship poultry programmes across the country.
 
 
Le développement rural durable ne peut que se faire sans l'autonomisation des jeunes ruraux pour l'esprit d'entreprise. Face au niveau actuel stupéfiant de chômage des jeunes au Nigéria, il est évident qu'il est nécessaire de chercher des moyens d'autonomiser les jeunes pour le développement durable. L'élevage de volailles est une ressource qui peut générer des emplois pour des millions de jeunes Nigérians dans les zones rurales et périurbaines en tant qu'entrepreneurs, travailleurs qualifiés et non qualifiés. Cet article, à travers un examen de la littérature, a examiné l'importance de la volaille et exploré comment elle peut être exploitée comme panacée pour le chômage des jeunes par l'entrepreneuriat. Il explore les potentiels de celui-ci et montre comment les potentiels de la volaille peuvent être exploités pour tous les programmes d'autonomisation des jeunes. Il a recommandé que le gouvernement, les grandes exploitations agricoles, les entreprises internationales et nationales participent à des programmes d'autonomisation des jeunes par l'entrepreneuriat des jeunes dans la production avicole. Les banques et autres institutions financières devraient avoir pour mandat d'aider les jeunes avec des prêts à taux doux en espèces et en nature par la fourniture d'infrastructures avicoles afin de rendre l'élevage avicole attrayant pour les jeunes. Un service consultatif bien financé de vulgarisation de la volaille doit être mis en place pour assurer la durabilité des programmes d'autonomisation des jeunes et d'entrepreneuriat de la volaille dans tout le pays.},

Its flows pervade the space. The lives of people and their material well-being directly depend on energy availability and the country's wealth from energy resources. At the same time, in the scientific literature, textbooks for technical universities, there are discrepancies, confusion in terms and definitions on this topic and no definition about energy. Based on the analysis, offered a clear and precise wording. It is necessary to strictly delineate the concepts of "forms of energy" and "types of energy", they are mixed even by venerable authors. The form of motion of matter determines the form of energy. Within each form of energy (motion) there are two types of energy. Potential energy "promises" the work, kinetic-it turns into it. In the modern list of forms of energy are 14 items. It probably is not the final one. It is assumed the existence of a vacuum energy inherent in the vacuum of space as the form of matter. It is underlined: increasing loads on the Nature (greenhouse effect, adding energy). The reserves of traditional fuel are depleted and the issue of the transition to the Green Energy is more acute. The well-being of people and society depends on the energy security, disposable and involved energy resources. The derivative here is the level of development of culture, sciences, arts, health and sociality. No any processes , movements are impossible without the expenditure of energy. Perpetual motion machine is not feasible and the energy is never enough [1, 2, 3, 4]. Table 1 serves as an illustration. Experts believe that the energy needs of developed countries will grow by 1,3 times by 2020 compared to 2000. The consumption of oil in them grows by 1 % per year, and in developing countries it increases by 2 % over the same period. The table provides data on per capita consumption (as an indicator of the quality of life of citizens) of electricity in some countries. Forecasts say that per capita electricity consumption in developed countries will exceed the global level by 3,55 times in 2020. The highest per capita consumption is expected in Canada-18,7 thousand kWh and the USA-14,7 thousand kWh. At the same time, more than 2 billion people in},

According to BP Statistical Review of World Energy, total global consumption of diesel from petroleum increasing in one decade which is 3.5 million tonnes in 2010 and 3.9 million tonnes in 2019. Despite reducing the dependence on fossil fuel, the question of how waste cooking oil (WCO) disposal and related environmental damage issues might be solved by biodiesel production. In Malaysia, an estimated 540 000 tonnes of WCO from vegetable and animal fats are discarded each year without being treated as wastes. WCO recognize as a raw material for biodiesel process and have a great potential. Biodiesel is made through a reaction between triglyceride and alcohol, with triglyceride being a raw material found primarily in plants and animals. Transesterification is the popular process of biodiesel production with low cost and mild reactions conditions. Some studies have done on the variable of transesterification process with the optimum condition of biodiesel production from WCO. This study examines WCO as a raw material for biodiesel production, including the various variables of transesterification process and a comparison of WCO biodiesel and petroleum diesel.},

   abstract = {The rising world population and its corresponding energy demands pose a considerable burden on natural energy sources. The exploitation of fossil fuels at such an alarming rate blurs the goals of sustainable development and controlling global warming as pledged during the Paris Agreement. Due to the detrimental effects of exhausts from conventional diesel fuel on the environment, biodiesel has earned significant importance during the last decade. Biodiesel is produced from different feedstocks such as neem oil, palm oil, waste frying oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, microbial oil, etc. These feedstocks react with acidic, alkaline, enzymic, homogeneous, heterogeneous, and hybrid Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) catalysts, along with monohydric alcohol via transesterification reaction. The flexibility in its feedstock and the type of catalysts used, production cost, biodegradable and renewable nature makes it a promising alternative fuel than conventional diesel. The selection of apt feedstock and catalyst is the challenging task and governing factor of economic biodiesel production. Green solvents such as DES have high thermal stability and low volatility and can address the economic and green production issues significantly as compared to conventional alkali and acid catalysts. This review bridges the gap between the selection of feedstock and optimal catalyst for the respective feedstock. The exploration of DES fills the gap by attributing to 3Rs (i.e., recyclability, recovery, and reusability). This review highlights the contemporary trends and prospects in the selection of the feedstocks, synthesis routes, and catalysts for the transesterification reactions for biodiesel production.},

   abstract = {An ever-increasing energy demand and environmental problems associated with exhaustible fossil fuels have led to the search for an alternative renewable source of energy. In this context, biodiesel has attracted attention worldwide as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuel for being renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable, and carbon-neutral. Although the homogeneous catalyst has its own merits, much attention is currently paid toward the chemical synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production as it can be tuned as per specific requirement and easily recovered, thus enhancing reusability. Recently, biomass-derived heterogeneous catalysts have risen to the forefront of biodiesel productions because of their sustainable, economical and eco-friendly nature. Furthermore, nano and bifunctional catalysts have emerged as a powerful catalyst largely due to their high surface area, and potential to convert free fatty acids and triglycerides to biodiesel, respectively. This review highlights the latest synthesis routes of various types of catalysts (including acidic, basic, bifunctional and nanocatalysts) derived from different chemicals, as well as biomass. In addition, the impacts of different methods of preparation of catalysts on the yield of biodiesel are also discussed in details.},

For biodiesel to be competitive, significant research has been focused on developing new and sustainable biodiesel production technologies to increase productivity. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the most recent developments in biodiesel production technologies was presented, including feedstocks, catalysts, reactors, and new processing technologies developed in recent years. The review showed that homogeneous and heterogeneous acid and base catalysts could achieve >90% conversion in biodiesel yield, while for enzymatic catalysts, it varied widely from around 70% to 99%, depending upon the feedstock type. Assisted by catalysts and alcohols, both batch and continuous flow reactors could achieve conversion yields by at least 89%. Also discussed were emerging technologies for biodiesel production, including plasma, microwave, and supercritical and ultrasonic radiation, along with the design process in membrane, microchannel, and reactive distillation reactors. Among the emerging technologies, the liquid-phase plasma discharge method was found to be most promising, reaching 99.5% yield in converting soybean oil to biodiesel in the shortest reaction time (seconds). In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of these emerging technologies were also reviewed.},

   abstract = {As Earth’s fossil energy resources are limited, there is a growing need for renewable resources such as biodiesel. That is the reason why the social, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels became an important research topic in the last decade. Depleted stocks of crude oil and the significant level of environmental pollution encourage researchers and professionals to seek and find solutions. The study aims to analyze the economic and sustainability issues of biodiesel production by a systematic literature review. During this process, 53 relevant studies were analyzed out of 13,069 identified articles. Every study agrees that there are several concerns about the first-generation technology; however, further generations cannot be price-competitive at this moment due to the immature technology and high production costs. However, there are promising alternatives, such as wastewater-based microalgae with up to 70% oil content, fat, oils and grease (FOG), when production cost is below 799 USD/gallon, and municipal solid waste-volatile fatty acids technology, where the raw material is free. Proper management of the co-products (mainly glycerol) is essential, especially at the currently low petroleum prices (0.29 USD/L), which can only be handled by the biorefineries. Sustainability is sometimes translated as cost efficiency, but the complex interpretation is becoming more common. Common elements of sustainability are environmental and social, as well as economic, issues.},

The renewable energy needs in the global energy supply must stabilize surface temperature rise to 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial values. To address the global climate issue and higher energy demand without depleting fossil reserves, growing bioenergy feedstock as the potential resource for biodiesel production could be a viable alternative. The interest in growing biofuels for biodiesel production has increased due to its potential benefits over fossil fuels and the flexibility of feedstocks.

The catalyst was characterised using scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential thermal analysis (DTA). The transesterification experiments were planned using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) while three expert systems namely response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were evaluated to assess their capacity to model and optimise the process. The results of characterisation of the catalyst indicated the suitability of the catalyst for the transesterification reaction which was attributed to the dominant elements which were calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe). The performance of the three optimisation tools was assessed using statistical indices and the results showed that ANFIS performed better than ANN and RSM in that order. This was demonstrated in the very high R2 value (R2 = 0.9999) and low error values (MSE = 0.0010, RMSE = 0.0059, SEP = 0.0074%, MAE = 0.0277 and AAD = 0.0325%). All three models predicted very high biodiesel yields (>98%) although ANFIS (yield = 99.30%) performed slightly better than ANN (yield = 99.10%). The properties of biodiesel produced at the optimised conditions were compared with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards and they were found to be within the acceptable limits indicating suitability of the fuel.},

In this study, the potential of a composite bio-based heterogeneous catalyst of fused crab shell and plantain peels was assessed for the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The catalyst and the precursor materials were characterized to assess their structural, compositional, morphological and thermal characteristics. Biodiesel production was carried out via a single step transesterification process while the experimental variables were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The morphological properties revealed an aggregated catalyst surface with clearly defined pores. The catalyst was bifunctional as evidenced by the presence of basic (calcium and potassium) and acidic oxides (silicon and iron). The catalyst had a high surface area (260.35 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g) which contributed to the maximum biodiesel yield of 93% obtained at a reaction temperature of 60 °C, catalyst loading of 5 wt%, reaction time of 149.94 min and methanol to oil ratio of 13.03:1. The RSM model was found to be very adequate in modeling biodiesel production (R2 = 0.9939). The catalyst was highly stable with high biodiesel yields (>80%) recorded after six cycles. The properties of the biodiesel were found to be comparable with standards. The synthesized catalyst holds numerous advantages over conventional catalysts because of its reusability, ease of synthesis, stability, high surface area and ready availability of the precursor materials.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel is considered eco-friendly, biodegradable, non-toxic, and carbon-neutral fuel. It is made from edible or non-edible oil feedstocks including other triglyceride sources. The production of biodiesel depends on the availability of a particular feedstock and the cost of desired raw materials. Biodiesel is mainly produced by the transesterification process using a suitable catalyst preferably a heterogeneous catalyst as it is more beneficial in terms of reusability, recovery, product purity, and production cost as well. Various reactors are developed to produce cost-effective biodiesel at the commercial level. The latest trend in biodiesel synthesis is the application of the machine learning (ML) technique to optimize the process parameters. The application of a mixture of two or more oils as feedstock either non-edible or edible oil is emphasized for biodiesel synthesis and is presently getting more importance. In this paper, the production of biodiesel from various mixed oil (hybrid oil) is reviewed and the effects of mixed oil on the reaction, physicochemical properties, fatty acid composition, and fuel quality of the product are discussed. The study highlighted the activity of various catalysts in the reaction of mixed oil and the economic feasibility. It was found that the ratio of mixed oil is an important factor in terms of conversion and quality of biodiesel. It is also revealed that the application of the ML technique is essentially useful to optimize production efficiency. The utilization of mixed oils will overcome the issues related to the non-availability of feedstocks and reduce the overall cost with improved quality of biodiesel. This approach enhances the production possibility of biodiesel at a large-scale and may boost the biorefinery sector satisfying the future energy demand if the research at the advanced level goes in the right direction.},

The solid catalyst was produced using a calcination method by burning raw SSS in the open air to obtain ash heated for 3 h in a furnace at 500 °C. The calcined sandbox shell ash (CSSA) produced was characterized using standard techniques to establish its catalytic potency. Also, a model was developed to simulate the process and examine the interactive effect of process input variables on SBOB yield using the Taguchi approach. The CSSA characterization showed it composed of K (44.99 %), Ca (1.54 %), and Mg (1.87 %) with crystalline compounds of K and Mg. The physisorption results gave a mean pore size of 18.142 nm and a surface area of 6.1125 m2/g. The best combination of the input variables determined for the process is a heating power of 450 W, methanol:SBO of 8:1, time of 1.5 min, and CSSA loading of 2 wt% with an optimum SBOB yield of 98.27 wt%. The SBOB produced met standard specifications for biodiesel. Microwave application to the SBO transesterification aided in rapidly completing the reaction. The study concluded that sandbox seeds and their shells are promising feedstock for cheap and sustainable biodiesel production.},

   abstract = {While biodiesel production and consumption for use in transportation has risen considerably over the last decade, its competitiveness in the marketplace is largely due to regulatory and fiscal support from governmental bodies, exceeding $25 billion in 2010 in the EU and US alone. The price of feedstocks represent 80-85% of the total biodiesel cost, and with over 350 different oil feedstocks available for blending, there is potential to optimize feedstock blends to reduce costs. This paper presents a chance-constrained optimization model that considers the technical constraints of conventional, first generation feedstocks, pricing trends, as well as the uncertainty and variation latent within these numbers. Further, the frequency with which a feedstock blend portfolio should be re-evaluated is considered through a case study. The model is then applied to a second case study for actual fuel constraint scenarios used in the EU and US. The results demonstrate the potential for substantial cost savings through targeted feedstock diversification, minimizing risks to producers from price fluctuations while still meeting technical fuel standards. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The traditional method of biodiesel synthesis is costly on industrial scale. Hence, heterogeneous catalysis is crucial in minimizing end-product costs thanks to high durability, efficiency, and substantial reusability. A significant criterion for impacting the biological production and survival of the farm is the renewable benefit of biodiesel feedstock and catalyst. The state-of-the-art biodiesel processing technologies for easy and low-cost production processes paid great attention to heterogeneous catalysts. The unique feature of the heterogeneous catalyst is its acid-based, surface, and pore tuning characteristics, which significantly enhance its flexible process feedstock. This review deals with the generations of biofuels, an overview of biodiesel synthesis and production processes, biodiesel production steps, raw materials for biodiesel production, heterogeneous catalysis, advantages of solid acid catalysis, the chemistry of heterogeneous acid catalysis, mechanism of heterogeneous acid catalysis, factors influencing the transesterification reaction, physico-chemical properties, purification of crude biodiesel, physico-chemical characterization of biodiesel, problems associated with the currently employed catalysts for biodiesel production, disadvantages and potential remedies with strong acid catalysts. Because of advanced technologies, there are several benefits to using heterogenous catalysts, such as simple, safe, cost-effective, and efficient biodiesel manufacturing. This review suggests that the utilization of heterogenous catalysts as solid catalysts in biodiesel synthesis looks promising.},

   abstract = {The reduction of oil resources and the consequent increasing price of oil distillates as well as the environmental concerns of conventional fuels has renewed and increased interest on the preparation of biofuels from renewable resources. One of those interests is nowadays focused on biodiesel, which is usually prepared from crude and refined triglyceride containing raw materials, such as vegetable oils, animal fats and wastes—for instance waste cooking oil and yellow and brown grease. Since several commercial interests converge on this kind of feedstock, one of the priorities being crops for human food supply, the research efforts on biodiesel production are diverting towards the use of low quality triglyceride-containing raw materials. Nevertheless, all of these feedstocks feature high water and free fatty acids (FFAs) content, which strongly affects the behaviour of conventional homogeneous base catalysts. These catalysts are primarily NaOH and KOH, but also NaOCH3 and KOCH3 are employed—as solutions in methanol—mainly in large-scale production plants. In this context, an appropriate solid acid catalyst which could simultaneously carry out esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglycerides would be of great interest for biodiesel production. Moreover, a heterogeneous acid catalyst could be easily incorporated into a packed bed continuous flow reactor, simplifying product separation and purification and reducing waste generation. The present review attempts to provide a wide overview on the possibility of heterogeneous acid catalysts for biodiesel production replacing the homogeneous conventional process. In this way, three aspects of solid acid catalysis for biodiesel production will be reviewed. The first section deals with the solid acid-catalyzed esterification of FFAs, the second topic relates to the transesterification of triglycerides, while the third deals with solid acid-catalyzed transformation of bioglycerol into oxygenated compounds for biodiesel formulation.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel fuel has shown great promise as an alternative to petro-diesel fuel. Biodiesel production is widely conducted through transesterification reaction, catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts or heterogeneous catalysts. The most notable catalyst used in producing biodiesel is the homogeneous alkaline catalyst such as NaOH, KOH, CH3ONa and CH3OK. The choice of these catalysts is due to their higher kinetic reaction rates. However because of high cost of refined feedstocks and difficulties associated with use of homogeneous alkaline catalysts to transesterify low quality feedstocks for biodiesel production, development of various heterogeneous catalysts are now on the increase. Development of heterogeneous catalyst such as solid and enzymes catalysts could overcome most of the problems associated with homogeneous catalysts. Therefore this study critically analyzes the effects of different catalysts used for producing biodiesel using findings available in the open literature. Also, this critical review could allow identification of research areas to explore and improve the catalysts performance commonly employed in producing biodiesel fuel. © 2012 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Serious environmental concerns regarding the use of fossil-based fuels have raised awareness regarding the necessity of alternative clean fuels and energy carriers. Biodiesel is considered a clean, biodegradable, and non-toxic diesel substitute produced via the transesterification of triglycerides with an alcohol in the presence of a proper catalyst. After initial separation of the by-product (glycerol), the crude biodiesel needs to be purified to meet the standard specifications prior to marketing. The presence of impurities in the biodiesel not only significantly affects its engine performance but also complicates its handling and storage. Therefore, biodiesel purification is an essential step prior to marketing. Biodiesel purification methods can be classified based on the nature of the process into equilibrium-based, affinity-based, membrane-based, reaction-based, and solid-liquid separation processes. The main adverse properties of biodiesel – namely moisture absorption, corrosiveness, and high viscosity – primarily arise from the presence of oxygen. To address these issues, several upgrading techniques have been proposed, among which catalytic (hydro)deoxygenation using conventional hydrotreating catalysts, supported metallic materials, and most recently transition metals in various forms appear promising. Nevertheless, catalyst deactivation (via coking) and/or inadequacy of product yields necessitate further research. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the techniques and methods used for biodiesel purification and upgrading.},

   abstract = {Biofuel has emerged as an alternative source of energy to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and combat global warming. Biofuels are classified into first, second, third and fourth generations. Each of the biofuel generations aims to meet the global energy demand while minimizing environmental impacts. Sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the current generations without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. The aim of sustainability is to ensure continuous growth of the economy while protecting the environment and societal needs. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability of these four generations of biofuels. The objectives are to compare the production of biofuel, the net greenhouse gases emissions, and energy efficiency. This study is important in providing information for the policymakers and researchers in the decision-making for the future development of green energy. Each of the biofuel generations shows different benefits and drawbacks. From this study, we conclude that the first generation biofuel has the highest biofuel production and energy efficiency, but is less effective in meeting the goal of reducing the greenhouse gases emission. The third generation biofuel shows the lowest net greenhouse gases emissions, allowing the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the energy required for the processing of the third generation biofuel is higher and, this makes it less environmentally friendly as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. The third and fourth generation feedstocks are the potential sustainable source for the future production of biofuel. However, more studies need to be done to find an alternative low cost for biofuel production while increasing energy efficiency.},

The main goal of this paper is to provide information to the engineers, industrialists and researchers who are interested on biodiesel and to emphasise biodiesel as a promising alternative replacement for fossil fuels. A substantial number of literatures from highly rated journals in scientific indexes were cited preferentially since 2000. The performance and emissions indicators such as brake torque, brake power, BTE, EGT, BSFC NOx, PM, CO, CO2, HC and smoke density have been evaluated in comparison to pure diesel. The results showed that different sources of biodiesel feedstocks give different results to engine performance and emissions. Surprisingly some of the research yielded favourable results towards the biodiesel as compared to pure diesel. The study concluded that biodiesel can be used in compression ignition engine as a replacement of diesel fuel to fulfil the global energy demand. However, further research on about optimisation, cost-effectiveness and availability of biodiesel needs to be carried out to help ensure that biofuel will be able to fully replace fossil fuel.},

Suitable combustion, appropriate atomization process, high flash point, and proper cetane number approved biodiesels as potential alternative for petroleum-based diesel fuels. Since, characteristics of biodiesels as well as biodiesel-diesel blends are directly related to their viscosity, an accurate approach is required for prediction of this important transport property. Therefore, this study tries to compare the accuracy of different empirical and intelligent paradigms for estimation of biodiesel-diesel blends. For this regard, the best topology of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) are determined at first, and then their predictive performances are compared with five empirical correlations in literatures. Combination of statistical study and ranking analysis justified that the LSSVM with polynomial kernel is the most accurate approach for the considered matter.

Biodiesel production is undergoing rapid and extensive technological reforms in industries and academia. The major obstacle in production and biodiesel commercialization path is production cost. Thus, in previous years numerous studies on the use of technologies and different methods to evaluate optimal conditions of biodiesel production technically and economically have been carried out. In this paper, a comparative review of the current technological methods so far used to produce biodiesel has been investigated. Four primary approaches to make biodiesel are direct use and blending of vegetable oils, micro-emulsions, thermal cracking (pyrolysis) and transesterification. Transesterification reaction, the most common method in the production of biodiesel, is emphasized in this review. The two types of transestrification process; catalytic and non-catalytic are discussed at length in the paper.

The properties of the various individual fatty esters that comprise biodiesel determine the overall fuel properties of the biodiesel fuel. In turn, the properties of the various fatty esters are determined by the structural features of the fatty acid and the alcohol moieties that comprise a fatty ester. Structural features that influence the physical and fuel properties of a fatty ester molecule are chain length, degree of unsaturation, and branching of the chain. Important fuel properties of biodiesel that are influenced by the fatty acid profile and, in turn, by the structural features of the various fatty esters are cetane number and ultimately exhaust emissions, heat of combustion, cold flow, oxidative stability, viscosity, and lubricity.

   abstract = {Biodiesel is a low-emissions diesel substitute fuel made from renewable resources and waste lipid. The most common way to produce biodiesel is through transesterification, especially alkali-catalyzed transesterification. When the raw materials (oils or fats) have a high percentage of free fatty acids or water, the alkali catalyst will react with the free fatty acids to form soaps. The water can hydrolyze the triglycerides into diglycerides and form more free fatty acids. Both of the above reactions are undesirable and reduce the yield of the biodiesel product. In this situation, the acidic materials should be pre-treated to inhibit the saponification reaction. This paper reviews the different approaches of reducing free fatty acids in the raw oil and refinement of crude biodiesel that are adopted in the industry. The main factors affecting the yield of biodiesel, i.e. alcohol quantity, reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration, are discussed. This paper also described other new processes of biodiesel production. For instance, the Biox co-solvent process converts triglycerides to esters through the selection of inert co-solvents that generates a one-phase oil-rich system. The non-catalytic supercritical methanol process is advantageous in terms of shorter reaction time and lesser purification steps but requires high temperature and pressure. For the in situ biodiesel process, the oilseeds are treated directly with methanol in which the catalyst has been preciously dissolved at ambient temperatures and pressure to perform the transesterification of oils in the oilseeds. This process, however, cannot handle waste cooking oils and animal fats. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The cost of biodiesel, however, is the main hurdle to commercialization of the product. The used cooking oils are used as raw material, adaption of continuous transesterification process and recovery of high quality glycerol from biodiesel by-product (glycerol) are primary options to be considered to lower the cost of biodiesel. There are four primary ways to make biodiesel, direct use and blending, microemulsions, thermal cracking (pyrolysis) and transesterification. The most commonly used method is transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats. The transesterification reaction is affected by molar ratio of glycerides to alcohol, catalysts, reaction temperature, reaction time and free fatty acids and water content of oils or fats. The mechanism and kinetics of the transesterification show how the reaction occurs and progresses. The processes of transesterification and its down-stream operations are also addressed.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

This oxygenated biofuel has been gaining high relevance due to its environmental benefits such as low carbon dioxide emissions, close to zero carbon monoxide emissions, and reduction in organic particle matters emitted by its combustion in a compression ignition engine. Among the possible options for the transformation of plant oils and animal fats to biodiesel, the catalyst-assisted alcoholysis process has been frequently selected. Recently, scientific attention has been driven toward the use of biocatalysts because they could be reutilized and products with high purity are obtained. This chapter discusses the proficiency of different free and immobilized enzyme catalysts to accelerate the alcoholysis reaction, factors affecting the process, and economic aspects of the technology.},

   abstract = {Biodiesel, a renewable fuel has a great potential in fulfilling an ever-increasing transport fuel demand. The enzymatic conversion process of feedstock oil to biodiesel is greener when compared to the conventional approach of chemical conversion due to mild reaction conditions and less wastewater generation. Lipases obtained from various microbial sources have been widely applied as catalysts for the conversion of oil to biodiesel. Biodiesel and glycerol obtained by enzymatic conversion have shown a higher purity as compared to that obtained by other conversion techniques. Enzymatic conversion of oil to biodiesel is less energy intensive because of milder reaction conditions and fewer purification steps involved in processing. Lipases, due to their catalytic efficiency and specificity, have emerged as a great tool for converting a wide range of feedstock oils to biodiesel. This manuscript presents an overview of the use of enzymatic conversion for making biodiesel production sustainable and environmentally-friendly. The constraints of enzymatic conversion are the high cost of the enzyme and its inhibition by alcohol and glycerol. The possible solutions to overcome these constraints are discussed. Recent advances to develop an effective process for enzymatic conversion of feedstock oils into biodiesel are critically evaluated. Prospective and challenges in scaling up of this technology are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The excessive utilization of petroleum resources leads to global warming, crude oil price fluctuations, and the fast depletion of petroleum reserves. Biodiesel has gained importance over the last few years as a clean, sustainable, and renewable energy source. This review provides knowledge of biodiesel production via transesterification/esterification using different catalysts, their prospects, and their challenges. The intensive research on homogeneous chemical catalysts points to the challenges in using high free fatty acids containing oils, such as waste cooking oils and animal fats. The problems faced are soap formation and the difficulty in product separation. On the other hand, heterogeneous catalysts are more preferable in biodiesel synthesis due to their ease of separation and reusability. However, in-depth studies show the limited activity and selectivity issues. Using biomass waste-based catalysts can reduce the biodiesel production cost as the materials are readily available and cheap. The use of an enzymatic approach has gained precedence in recent times. Additionally, immobilization of these enzymes has also improved the statistics because of their excellent functional properties like easy separation and reusability. However, free/liquid lipases are also growing faster due to better mass transfer with reactants. Biocatalysts are exceptional in good selectivity and mild operational conditions, but attractive features are veiled with the operational costs. Nanocatalysts play a vital role in heterogeneous catalysis and lipase immobilization due to their excellent selectivity, reactivity, faster reaction rates owing to their higher surface area, and easy recovery from the products and reuse for several cycles.},

This work explores using an equal mixture of chicken waste (CW) and chicken bones (CBs) as a raw material for creating more valuable products. The CW (chicken skin and fat) were de-fatted, and their solid residue leftover was blended with CBs and utilized as a pyrolysis feedstock to create bio-oil (BO) and bio-char (BC). The waste blend was thermally pyrolyzed over a range of temperatures (400–600 °C) and periods (30–150 min) numerous range of heating rates (5–20 °C/min). The highest yield of liquid fractions (61.60%) was achieved at 500 °C for 120 min at a 10 °C/min rate of heating. The BO content of the liquid fraction amounted to 25.225%. According to the FTIR outcomes, the produced BO is a complex mixture of many organic compounds, including carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cyclic compounds, etc.). The fuel characteristics of the synthetic BO were similar to those reported for numerous samples of BO in the literature. It also offered its suitability as a synthetic fuel for engines and a probable source of chemical feedstock. The BC leftover after the pyrolysis of the waste mixture was exploited as catalyst support. It was impregnated with different ratios (10–50%) of KOH. The typical sample (40K/BC) was identified by SABET, FE-SEM, EDX, XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy. The efficiency and performance of the 40K/BC catalyst for transesterification of a blend of chicken fat and waste cooking oil to biodiesel (BD) were explored under diverse operating conditions. The highest BD yield (94.88%) was obtained in 90 min at 60 °C reaction temperature using a 4.0 wt% 40K/BC catalyst and 9:1methanol: lipid blend molar ratio. Additionally, the developed catalyst (40K/BC) demonstrated sustained activity after five cycles of recycling and reusing with a BD yield of >84.0%. The BD characteristics met the requirements of ASTM D6751 and EN 14,214. The ester content in the BD amounted to 96.36% based on 1HNMR analysis.},

However, the researcher's interest has shifted to renewable energy sources in an effort to minimise the dependence on fossil fuels due to the continuously rising energy demand. Furthermore, the harmful effects of these fossil fuels on the ecosystem contribute to global warming. Biodiesels are the most practical form of green energy in that situation. The word bio stands for its natural origin, while diesel stands for its use as fuel, as the name implies. Traditionally, transesterification is used to create biodiesel. With the aid of a suitable heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst, this reaction can take place, however amount of fatty acids it contains determines the best catalyst to use. Recently, heterogeneous catalysts have been preferred over homogenous catalysts as it can be reusable and can be easily separated. Moreover, homogeneous catalyst produces soap as a by-product and massive wastewater, further increasing allowable discharge costs. This paper reviews about biodiesel used as an alternative source of energy and its various prospects. This work reviews about the various heterogeneous catalyst and also analyses its effect on the thereafter biodiesel yield. This work also emphasis on the usage of waste or non-edible materials as a feedstock as it would help to lower the cost of production.

At present 95% of the biodiesel production is contributed by edible oils worldwide whereas recycled oils and animal fats contribute 10% and 6% respectively. Although every process has its own limitations, the enzyme efficiency, resistance to alcohols, and recovery rate are the crucial factors to be addressed.
